When a client first join a room, a cube will be instantiated(Here we call **Mine Cube**).You will be cloned(Here we call **Clone Cube**) on other client when other one join the same room.You can click the **Mine Cube** to change the colors,it can be synced by using **[RPC](https://github.com/netgo-framework/netgo-unity-client/tree/master/Assets/Netgo/Application/RPC)**:

And we click **Move** button to let the two cubes move.We here use **[View Sync](https://github.com/netgo-framework/netgo-unity-client/tree/master/Assets/Netgo/Application/ViewSynchronizer)** to sync the positions and rotations for each other:

When you click the **Clone Cube**,we here **[Custom Event](https://github.com/netgo-framework/netgo-unity-client/tree/master/Assets/Netgo/Application/CustomEvent)** to send a message to **Mine Cube**.
